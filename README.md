Quantum Computing Playground
ðŸŽ¯ What's Working Now:
âœ… Qubit Basics

Toggle classical bit between 0 and 1
Create quantum superposition
Measure qubit and see collapse

âœ… Superposition

Adjust alpha coefficient with slider
Real-time wave function visualization
Probability bars update dynamically
Measure and see collapse result

âœ… Bloch Sphere

Control theta (Î¸) and phi (Ï†) angles
3D visualization of qubit state on sphere
See mathematical state representation

âœ… Quantum Gates

Add H, X, Y, Z, T, S gates to circuit
Visual circuit builder
Run circuit and see final state
Clear circuit to start over

âœ… Entanglement

Create Bell state entanglement
Animated entanglement particles
Measure either qubit
See instant correlation (spooky action!)

âœ… Decoherence

Start/pause/reset decoherence process
Adjust noise level (Very Low to Critical)
Watch coherence decay from 100% to 0%
See wave function degradation

âœ… Error Correction

Encode single qubit into 3-qubit code
Introduce random errors
Detect and correct errors
Visual feedback with colors
